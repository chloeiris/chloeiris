### ABOUT ME
👩‍💻 I am very persistent until the code works well, i.e., no secrets under the rug.

✨I like when my work is flawless, though yes, work is often better done than perfect. 

💭I enjoy discussing data modeling, Python, nature, society, philosophy, and women in tech - including the “poetic” scientist Ada Lovelace, who’s often regarded as the world’s first computer programmer.
